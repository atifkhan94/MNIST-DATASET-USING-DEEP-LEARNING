# MNIST-DATASET-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification. This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify digits (0-9) with high accuracy. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
